# scrollright
A repository for issues and information about display bugs caused by increasing OS font size

## What is a scrollright bug?

If you increase your system font size in your operating system's settings, many websites (about half) will no longer display correctly.  The most common way this manifests is that the website is now too wide for the monitor, and one has to scroll to the right to see some of it.  In some cases the site is only a little too wide, and annoyingly wobbles horizontally when scrolling vertically on a trackpad.  In a few cases, text or other features are hidden, in a way that the user might not be aware of or be able to correct for by zooming out.

## Why did you create this repo?

When you create a project in Github, it gives you an issue tracker.  This seems like a good place to keep track of sites that currently have scrollright bugs, and discuss efforts to get the site owners to fix them.  Additionally, the repo can serve as a resource for people trying to fix those sites, or avoid the issue while developing new sites.  

## Why might someone want to increase their system font size?

I increased mine when someone said this helped with their eye strain.  It helped mine as well.

## What systems does this issue appear on?

I've so far observed it on a macOS laptop, in Chrome and Firefox.  I have no reason to suspect it's specific to these systems.

## What websites does this happen on?

A lot of them, though perhaps by the time you read this it will be a lot less.  For a current list, see the [Issues](https://github.com/dmoney/scrollright/issues) tab on this repo.

## What causes scrollright bugs?

At this point, I don't know.  Presumably a bug in the site's CSS.  I'll add more info as I learn more.  If you know, feel free to submit a PR.

## How can we get a site owner to fix a scrollright bug?

I haven't tried yet, so I don't know.  Bug reporting methods will probably vary a lot from site to site, as they're all owned by different companies or individuals, with different software, processes, etc.  It could involve a publically available e-mail address or contact form, or they may have their own github or other issue tracker that you can publicly view or submit issues to.  I'll add more advice as I learn more.

If you do try to get a site owner to fix a bug, and you refer to or contribute to this repo at all, please be nice the site owner (and their employees if applicable), even if they may not initially be receptive to investigating or fixing it.
